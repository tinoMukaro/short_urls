#  URL Shortener (TypeScript + Docker)

A minimal URL Shortener API built with **Express**, **TypeScript**, and **PostgreSQL**, containerized using **Docker**.  
This project was created as a small personal exercise to practice working with **TypeScript**, **Docker**, and database integration.

---

##  Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** – for type-safe backend logic  
- **Express.js** – lightweight Node.js web framework  
- **PostgreSQL** – relational database for storing URLs  
- **Drizzle ORM** – simple and type-safe ORM for SQL queries  
- **Docker & Docker Compose** – for containerization and easy setup
